phpfarm for docker
==================
This is a Fork from splitbrain/docker-phpfarm.
Big Thanks to Andreas Gohr from splitbrains.org who have initiate this.
 
This is a build file to create a [phpfarm](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpfarm/)
setup.The resulting docker image will run Apache on 5 different ports with 5
different PHP versions:

Port | PHP Version
-----|-------------
8052 | 5.2.17
8053 | 5.3.29
8054 | 5.4.44
8055 | 5.5.28
8056 | 5.6.12

Building the image
------------------

After checkout, simply run the following command:

    docker build -t xstable/phpfarm .

This will setup a base Debian system, install phpfarm, download and compile the included
PHP versions and setup Apache. This will take a while. See the next section
for a faster alternative.

Downloading the image
-----------------

Simply downloading the ready made image from index.docker.io is probably the fastest
way. Just run this:

    docker pull xstable/phpfarm


Running the container
---------------------

The following will run the container and map all ports to their respective ports on the
local machine. The current working directory will be used as the document root for
the Apache server and the server it self will run with the same user id as your current
user.

    docker run --rm -t -i -e APACHE_UID=$UID -v $PWD:/var/www:rw -p 8052:8052 -p 8053:8053 -p 8054:8054 -p 8055:8055 -p 8056:8056 xstable/phpfarm

Above command will also remove the container again when the process is aborted with
CTRL-C. While running the Apache and PHP error log is shown on STDOUT.

Note: the entry point for this image has been defined as ''/bin/bash'' and it will
run our ''run.sh'' by default. You can specify other parameters to be run by bash
of course.

Apache Magic
------------

This images adds an automatic Virtual Host mapping to the source phpfarm image. 
VHost folder mapping works transparently inside this image. Let's say your docker container gets the ip 192.168.1.1. 
When you access http://192.168.1.1:8054 apache will serve the folder /var/www which give you an error. When you add an alias for the ip (via /etc/hosts or dns), e.g. host1.local, and access it via its new name http://host1.local:8054 apache will serve the folder /var/www/host1/. If the alias is host1.ad.local.lan the directory will still be /var/www/host1, because only the first part of the alias name is used to determine the path to serve.

When you access http://host2.whatever you'll get /var/www/host2 and so on... 

Please notice that the hostname always will be lowercased. You can only access folders / subdomains in lowercase.

The main purpose of this technique is to have your Projects dir mounted on /var/www with each sub-project below it. e.g. projekts/project-a, prjects/project-b ... so you can access them as project-a.whatever and project-b.whatever. In combination with phpfarm this gives project-a.whatever:8053 for project-a with php 5.3 or project-a.whatever:8054 for project-a with php verion 5.4. 

This technique is powerfull with a wildcard dns string like *.mytestdomain which maps to exactly the same ip address for all subdomains. you'll never need to touch you apache config for VHost configuration again.

See: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/vhosts.html for more information

To Do
-----

- [ ] adjust the build process to have a single file to configure PHP versions and ports
- [ ] optimize the Dockerfile to be more space and update efficient

Feedback
--------

This is the first time I ever worked with docker. Pullrequests and hints on how
to improve the process are very welcome.
